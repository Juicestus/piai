Code for a Raspberry Pi Computer Vision Robot

Just some stuff to screw around with.
I wrote most of this either the afternoon of new years eve or from 1am - 4am new years day.
I have never had much time to integrate with the robot. (our edc robot with a RPI stuck on top)
Also RPI have not enuf processing power, [check out this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSVEUlLuIj0-5ZJ62lxxtCNqVpLfGpT9G9-sV6PyPFg/edit?usp=sharing)
Could probably speed it up with Cython, PyPy, et cetera. Could speed it up by writing it in C++, but the development cycle would be maybe to long idk?
Ima buy a Coral anyways, a board similar to an RPI but with a nueral engine.
